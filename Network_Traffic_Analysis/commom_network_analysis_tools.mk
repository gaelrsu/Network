| Tool              | Description                                                                                                                                          |

| tcpdump           | tcpdump is a command-line utility that, with the aid of LibPcap, captures and interprets network traffic from a network interface or capture file.  |
| Tshark            | TShark is a network packet analyzer much like TCPDump. It will capture packets from a live network or read and decode from a file.                 |
| Wireshark         | Wireshark is a graphical network traffic analyzer. It captures and decodes frames off the wire and allows for an in-depth look into the environment. |
| NGrep             | NGrep is a pattern-matching tool built to serve a similar function as grep for Linux distributions. It works with network traffic packets.           |
| tcpick            | tcpick is a command-line packet sniffer that specializes in tracking and reassembling TCP streams.                                                |
| Network Taps      | Taps (Gigamon, Niagra-taps) are devices capable of taking copies of network traffic and sending them to another place for analysis.                    |
| Networking Span Ports | Span Ports copy frames from layer two or three networking devices and send them to a collection point for analysis.                                |
| Elastic Stack     | The Elastic Stack ingests data from many sources, visualizes it, and enables searching and analysis.                                                |
| SIEMS             | SIEMS (such as Splunk) are central points where data is analyzed, visualized, and used for alerting and forensic analysis.                            |
